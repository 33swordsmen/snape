# Snape

Snape is a convenient artificial dataset generator that wraps sklearn's make_classification and make_regression
and then adds in 'realism' features such as complex formating, varying scales, categorical variables,
and missing values.

## Motivation

Snape was primarily created for academic and educational settings.  It has used to create datasets that are unique per
student, per assignment for various homework assignments.  It has also been used to create class wide assessments in
conjunction with 'Kaggle In the Classroom.'

Other users have suggested non-academic uses cases as well, including 'interview screening problems,' model comparison,
etc.
